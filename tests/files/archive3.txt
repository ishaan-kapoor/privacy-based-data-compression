FUTURE-AI: Guiding Principles and Consensus Recommendations for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Future Medical ImagingThe recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) combined with the
extensive amount of data generated by today's clinical systems, has led to the
development of imaging AI solutions across the whole value chain of medical
imaging, including image reconstruction, medical image segmentation,
image-based diagnosis and treatment planning. Notwithstanding the successes and
future potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of
the potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are
perceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust
in critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are
currently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI
developments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.
To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding
principles drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best
practices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These
guiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)
Fairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness
and (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are
further translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,
developing, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically
trustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.

We propose a novel neural-network-based method to perform matting of videos
depicting people that does not require additional user input such as trimaps.
Our architecture achieves temporal stability of the resulting alpha mattes by
using motion-estimation-based smoothing of image-segmentation algorithm
outputs, combined with convolutional-LSTM modules on U-Net skip connections.
  We also propose a fake-motion algorithm that generates training clips for the
video-matting network given photos with ground-truth alpha mattes and
background videos. We apply random motion to photos and their mattes to
simulate movement one would find in real videos and composite the result with
the background clips. It lets us train a deep neural network operating on
videos in an absence of a large annotated video dataset and provides
ground-truth training-clip foreground optical flow for use in loss functions.train a neural network model, e.g. to detect copyright abuses. We show that
models with higher dimensional input and output are more vulnerable to MIA, and
address in more detail models for image translation and semantic segmentation,
including medical image segmentation. We show that reconstruction-errors can
lead to very effective MIA attacks as they are indicative of memorization.
Unfortunately, reconstruction error alone is less effective at discriminating
between non-predictable images used in training and easy to predict images that
were never seen before. To overcome this, we propose using a novel
predictability error that can be computed for each sample, aMembership inference attacks (MIA) try to detect if data samples were used tond its computation
does not require a training set. Our membership error, obtained by subtracting
the predictability error from the reconstruction error, is shown to achieve
high MIA accuracy on an extensive number of benchmarks.
